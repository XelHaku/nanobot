# Heartbeat Tasks

This file is checked periodically by your nanobot agent (when heartbeat is enabled).
Add tasks below that you want the agent to work on at each interval.

If this file has no tasks (only headers and comments), the agent will skip the heartbeat.

## Active Tasks

<!-- Examples:
- Check disk space and alert if > 90% full
- Pull latest changes on main branch
- Run test suite and report failures
-->
